Cryptsetup for Centrych
-----------------------

Centrych modifies /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/cryptroot to
provide user-friendly prompts at startup when full disk encryption was selected
during installation.

After 3 failed passphrase attempts the system will be powered off to slow down,
and/or frustrate unauthorized attempts to access to your system.
